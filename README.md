- Week-1: Boolean Logic  
- Week-2: Boolean Arithmetic  
- Week-3: Sequential Logic  
- Week-4: Machine Language  
- Week-5: Computer Architecture  
- Week-6: Assembler  

PART 2:
- Week-7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic  
- Week-8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control  
- Week-9: High-Level Language  
- Week-10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis  
- Week-11: Compiler II: Code Generation  
- Week-12: Operating System
